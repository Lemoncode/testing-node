# Steps to build it

## Prerequisites

- In order to follow this step guides you will also need to take sample _00 Boilerplate_ as starting point.

- Let's start by installing the necessary libraries:

- [jest](https://github.com/facebook/jest): JavaScript Testing library with runner, assertion, mocks, etc.
- [@types/jest](https://github.com/DefinitelyTyped/DefinitelyTyped/tree/df38f202a0185eadfb6012e47dd91f8975eb6151/types/jest): Typings for jest.
- [ts-jest](https://github.com/kulshekhar/ts-jest): A preprocessor with sourcemap support to help use Typescript with Jest.

```bash
npm install jest @types/jest ts-jest -D

```
